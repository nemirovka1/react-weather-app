#The typical workflow for getting started with a Create React App project involves running two commands:
1. `npm install`: This command is used to install the necessary dependencies and modules specified in your project's `package.json` file. It should be run once when you first create your React application or when you clone an existing project from a code repository. This command fetches and installs the required packages, making your project ready for development.
2. `npm start`: After running `npm install` to install the dependencies, you can start your development server using this command. It launches the development server, compiles your React code, and opens your application in a web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes you make to your code will be automatically detected and your app will refresh to reflect those changes.

So, in summary, you install the required packages with `npm install` initially, and then start the development server with `npm start` to work on your React application. These two commands are the standard way to kickstart your React project and begin the development process.
